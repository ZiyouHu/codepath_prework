## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
### App: Clcok
### Features:
- Update TimeZone based on where the device is currently located. Users can immediately know their new time zone and avoid the time zone lookups and caluclations.
- Switch between 12h and 24h time system. This accomodates users of different preferences.
- Set alarms on repeat. Say a user needs to take medication at 8am every morning. The repeat feature serves as a reminder for the user.

### App: Uber
### Features: 
- Realtime update of where the driver is.
- Provide arrival time estimate.

### App: Photos
### Features:
- Record when and where a photo was taken
- Identify the theme of the photo--people, animals, landscapes, or documents.

### App Idea

I want to improve the QR code recognition featurs on Photos.
Whenever I want to access a QR code, I need to rescan it each time. I want the app to auto-recognize the QR code and saves the link with the photo. With this new feature, I can just click on the link instead of rescanning if I want to access the content again.
Also, if a photo contains multiple QR codes, I want the app to provide a list of links to me, so that I can choose which link to direct me to.
